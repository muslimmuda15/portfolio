## Developer Information

This application is maintained by muslimmuda15 and is available at https://github.com/muslimmuda15/Smart-AutoClicker. This is a modified version based on the original Smart AutoClicker project by Nain57, available at https://github.com/Nain57/Smart-AutoClicker. The original project is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0).

## Information We Collect

### Information We DO NOT Collect

AMB - Smart AutoClicker is designed with privacy as a priority. We want to be clear about what we **DO NOT** collect:

- **No Personal Information**: We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any other personally identifiable information.
- **No Usage Analytics**: We do not track how you use the application, what features you access, or how often you use the app.
- **No Location Data**: We do not access, collect, or store your device's location information.
- **No Device Information**: We do not collect information about your device, including device model, operating system version, or unique device identifiers.
- **No Screen Content**: While the app uses screen capture for image detection purposes, all processing is done locally on your device. No screenshots or screen content are transmitted or stored outside your device.
- **No Network Communication**: The app does not send any data to external servers or third parties, except when you explicitly use the API feature to load actions from your own specified API endpoint.

### Information Stored Locally

The following information is stored **only on your device** and is never transmitted elsewhere:

- **Automation Scenarios**: Your created automation scenarios, including clicks, swipes, and image detection configurations.
- **Screenshots for Detection**: Images captured for image detection purposes are stored locally and used only for automation matching.
- **App Settings**: Your preferences and configuration settings for the application.

## Permissions Required

AMB - Smart AutoClicker requires certain permissions to function properly:

### Accessibility Service

- **Purpose**: Required to perform automated clicks, swipes, and other actions on your behalf.
- **Usage**: This permission allows the app to interact with other applications to execute your automation scenarios.
- **Data Access**: While this permission technically allows access to screen content, we only use it for the specific automation tasks you configure. No data is collected, stored permanently, or transmitted.

### Screen Capture/Overlay

- **Purpose**: Required for image detection and displaying floating controls.
- **Usage**: Allows the app to capture screenshots for image matching and display overlay buttons.
- **Data Access**: Screenshots are processed in real-time and stored only if you explicitly save them as part of your automation scenario.

### Storage Access

- **Purpose**: To save and load your automation scenarios.
- **Usage**: Allows the app to read and write scenario files on your device.

### Internet Access (Optional)

- **Purpose**: Only used when you choose to use the API feature to load automation actions.
- **Usage**: When you configure an API endpoint, the app will make network requests to that endpoint to retrieve action configurations.
- **Data Transmitted**: Only the data necessary to communicate with your specified API endpoint.

## Third-Party Services

AMB - Smart AutoClicker does not integrate any third-party analytics, or tracking services. The app operates entirely offline, except when you explicitly configure and use the API feature.

## API Feature

If you choose to use the API feature to load automation actions:

- You are responsible for the API endpoint you configure.
- The app will send requests to your specified API endpoint to retrieve action configurations.
- We do not control or have access to the API endpoints you configure.
- Please review the privacy policy of any third-party API service you choose to use.

- We recommend using device encryption and secure lock screens.
- If you uninstall the app, all locally stored data will be removed according to Android's standard app data handling.
